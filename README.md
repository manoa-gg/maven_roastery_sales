# maven_roastery_sales
Using mysql to do data analysis over fictional company called maven roastery.  In this simple analysis I'm doing EDA to find best performing branch, product, sales trend, month on month sales, etc. Before the analysis begun I do several data transformation, transforming day of the week, 24 hours, and also extracting month from date after that analysis doing CTE, limit, and 1 subquery.
